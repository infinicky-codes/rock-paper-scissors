# rock-paper-scissors
First JavaScript Basics project for The Odin Project's Foundation Course.

The game will be played against the computer, which will randomly choose either Rock, Paper or Scissors. 
Your chosen input of Rock, Paper or Scissors is case-insensitive (so you can input `rock`, `ROCK`, `RocK` or any other variation).

After each round, the computer will display the winner. 
The game will be played for a total of 5 rounds and then the ultimate winner is declared.
